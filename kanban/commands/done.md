# /kanban:done

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

Close out a task. The Skill `kanban-workflow` governs the rules.

## 0. Driver check

Read `kanban.json`. Look at `backend.driver`. If absent, treat as `"local"`.
If `"jira"`, follow the Jira flow at the end of this file.

## 1. Parse arguments (local driver)

- `<task-id>` — explicit task to close. If omitted, the helper finds the
  single DOING task with `assignee == "claude-code"`. If 0 or >1, the
  helper returns an error listing the candidates; ask the user which one.
- `--note=<text>` — optional closing comment. Quoted values supported.

## 2. Run the helper

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/kanban_local.py done \
  --kanban-path '<kanban.json path>' \
  [--task-id task-NNN] [--note '<text>']
```

The helper enforces APPROVED-only-from-DOING, sets `completed`, appends the
note as a comment, and writes atomically. **Do not** call Write/Edit on
`kanban.json`.

## 3. Report

| Shape | Action |
|---|---|
| `{ok: true, id, title, completed, unblocked: [...]}` | print done line; if `unblocked` is non-empty, list those task ids |
| `{ok: false, error, doing: [...]}` | the user has multiple DOING tasks. Show the list and ask which one. |
| `{ok: false, error}` | surface and stop |

Format:

> ✓ <id> "<title>" → APPROVED.
> Unblocked: <id-1>, <id-2> (was waiting on <id>).

Omit the "Unblocked" line when none.

## Jira flow

In Jira mode, `/kanban:done` transitions DOING → REVIEW. The APPROVED step is
reserved for a human reviewer — anti-self-approve refuses if the same AP
tries to push to APPROVED.

Identify the target key from `$ARGUMENTS`. If absent, find the single DOING
card with this repo's AP set (use `/kanban:status` to enumerate; if there
is not exactly one, ask the user).

**Flavor handling (#45)**: when `kanban.json#backend.jira.transitions.REVIEW`
declares a `flavors` block, this command must pick one. `/kanban:done`
ALWAYS means "I finished, please review", so pass `--flavor
awaiting_approval` (the conventional name; check
`backend.jira.transitions.REVIEW.flavors` for the actual key — the team
may have named it differently). When the REVIEW spec has no `flavors`
block, omit `--flavor` (helper ignores stray values when no flavors).

For the *other* REVIEW flavor — "I'm stuck, here are options, please
decide" — that is **not** `/kanban:done`'s job. Use `/kanban:transition
--to REVIEW --flavor needs_decision` directly after posting the options
comment. See `kanban-jira-agent` SKILL for the @-mention authorization
contract that triggers that path.

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/jira_setup.py transition \
  --kanban-path '<kanban.json path>' --key '<KEY>' --to REVIEW \
  [--flavor awaiting_approval]
```

On success print `✓ <KEY> → In Review (awaiting reviewer)`.

If the helper exits with `kind: self-approve`, surface the error verbatim
and explain another reviewer is required. Do NOT search for workarounds.

If the helper rejects with `transition to 'REVIEW' requires --flavor`,
the team's DSL declares `flavors` but no `defaultFlavor`. Pick
`awaiting_approval` (or whatever the equivalent key is in their
`flavors` map) and re-run. Do NOT add a `defaultFlavor` to kanban.json
on the user's behalf — that's a team policy decision.

## Absolute rules

- Never close a task that isn't DOING (local mode — helper enforces).
- Never retroactively edit `created` or `started`.
- Never close multiple tasks in one invocation.
- Never call Write/Edit on `kanban.json` — go through the helper.
- Jira mode: never push REVIEW → APPROVED for a card whose AP equals this
  repo's AP. The plugin refuses; do not retry.
