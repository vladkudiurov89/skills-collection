"""Phase 20 regression checks for kanban v0.3.13 — `cmd_health` hint
when the active driver is local.

Closes #31. The `health` helper was being used as the oracle for "are
Jira credentials present?" in `/kanban:initjira-by-code` step 1 — but at
that point `kanban.json#backend.driver` is still `"local"`, so health
runs against `LocalDriver` (which has nothing Jira-related to check)
and unconditionally returns ok. Callers silently bypassed credential
capture and only failed multiple steps later.

The fix on the slash-command side is a doc change (use `read-credentials`
+ `tokenPresent`). On the helper side we can't safely flip `ok` to false
for the local driver — `/kanban:init`'s legitimate post-init health
check would break. Instead we append a hint to the `detail` field so
any caller that prints it self-diagnoses the misuse.

Cases:
  (a) `cmd_health` with `backend.driver == "local"` keeps `ok=true` but
      `detail` mentions `local driver` and `read-credentials`.
  (b) `cmd_health` with `backend.driver == "jira"` (and missing creds —
      i.e. unauthenticated) returns the underlying driver detail
      unchanged — the local-driver hint is NOT appended.
